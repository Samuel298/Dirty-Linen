                    <q> After a bumpy encounter, two strangers fight for the only working dryer at the local laundromat.</q>
                    <p>Dirty Linen is the story of an  encounter between CORA BERTHIER (51),  a wiser Carrie Bradshaw with a Parisian attitude  and KEV KOSTNER  (23) — with a K, a Peter Pan in ripped jeans and London accent. On a not so ordinary Friday, the two of them literally bump into each other on the sidewalk, pushed by a random KID ON A SCOOTER (10)… and inevitably getting splashed by his milkshake.  This event takes place in front of the local laundromat, The Long Lane Launderette, empty and charming as usual, glowing with its blue and yellow colors. Kev and Cora decide to take this opportunity to wash their clothes quickly in order to be sparkly and clean for their important meetings happening later on. From there start a series of laundromat crisis, accompanied with playful yet serious bickering between the two of them…</p>

                    <h1>THE WRITER’S NOTE</h1>
                    <p>Writers seek for inspiration in every place they can. At home, at the pub, walking down the street... A potential story hides itself in every little detail. For DIRTY LINEN, it was a Sunday stroll in the neighborhood.</p>
                    <p>The blue and yellow sign of the Long Lane Launderette caught my eye and I didn't want to walk anymore. I wanted to stay there and immerse myself into those colors, into this atmosphere generated by the place that felt so cinematic and inspiring. Colors and spaces can be enough for a story to emerge. </p>
                    <p>For a long time now, I have been dramatically interested in the thematic of the encounter. This obsession helped me graduate from King's College with a First at my dissertation — The Philosophical Encounters in the cinema of Richard Linklater. Lengthy title, academic writing, but a whole lot of love and passion.</p>
                    <p>Encounters happen and lead us into physical or metaphysical places; they change us. That's , in a nutshell, what I spend 37 pages discussing in the dissertation.  What I spend 15 pages discussing in Dirty Linen. What Linklater has Céline (Julie Delpy) articulate so beautifully in Before Sunrise: "If there is any king of magic in this world, it must be in the attempt of understanding someone, sharing something".</p>
                    <p>Dirty Linen was born originally as an imaginary conversation I envisioned between Jesse and Céline, if their encounter had taken them in London, in this Launderette. Then, in the development of the dialogue, the images started shifting in my head. </p> </br>
                        The characters in the space now were different. Dramatically different. Opposites, in fact. Different in terms of age, education, lifestyles....in everything.</br> 
                         I pictured a young slacker named KEV (23), cruising through life a little clueless, a little careless. And in front of him, shooting back quirky comments at him, a presumably high-maintenance, liberated woman, CORA (51). They were inside the Launderette, as two strangers, firing at each other ironical statements, relentless, passionate about their fight. But what were they fighting for exactly? And why such a lady as Cora would be in a laundromat? And why Kev would bother do laundry?</br> 
                        
                        
                        
                        <br> Those questions led me to put the story down in scenes. And I absolutely loved writing it. And now I should stop blabbering about it and you should just read it. And one day, soon, you will be able to watch it.</p>
